- Adherance to the C++ [Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines)
- Pilot CTest and BDD-Style TDD using [Catch<sup>2</sup>](https://github.com/catchorg/Catch2)
- [AppVeyor](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R8OrWVVf5CM) or Travis CI
- Use of [Key-based](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh) authentication
- https://www.appveyor.com/
- Explore Unity as a visualisation tool for the front end of the simulator

The RRA Team are currently working on a collaborative C++ project on home PCs with the goal of writing a simple engine for simulating Radar Targets. This is an innovation project with opportunities to experience software development from an open source application based development perspective while experimenting with some extreme programming and learning while promoting a culture of continuous learning.

Interpersonal/Team Objectives: 
- Trial free software for remote communication and collaboration 
- Building inter-team awareness and broadening college support networks
- Share knowledge/interests in areas related to the Software/Radar domain 
- Keeping our software process lean and robust and free 
- Applying easy to use open-source automation techniques and feedback 
- Building low waste/robust software process using
- Keeping work fun and everyone self-motivated 

Technical/Company Objectives: 
- Developing and diversifying our c++ expertise; C++11 or above, GSL... 
- Practice reuse of commercial grade public C++ libraries 
- Trial some architecture we were hoping to use in our commercial code
- Produce a prototype a target simulator
